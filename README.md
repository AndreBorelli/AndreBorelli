- 👋 Hi  , My name is André Borelli, I am from Brazil and with Portuguese nationality (European Union).
-  I have a degree in Information Technology Management from the "Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Campinas - PUCC"
- 👀 I’m interested in deepen as a front-end developer and later on become a Fullstack Developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS, and fascinated by the results that this library can generate, through the componentization of the elements,  in addition to the dynamism that it allows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on in any company that shows the way to a constant professional evolution and has our belief that any outstanding professional was already a "beginner", being that normally his evolution was a mixture of several parallel processes such as: his ability to learn and assimilate knowledge, the opportunities that appeared to him, the complexity and characteristics of the projects and professionals that helped him on his journey.
